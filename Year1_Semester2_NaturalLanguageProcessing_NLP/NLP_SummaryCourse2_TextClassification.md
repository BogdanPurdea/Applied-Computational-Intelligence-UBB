## 📖 2.1 **Text Classification (Categorization)**

**Definition:** Text classification is the automated process of assigning natural language texts to one or more predefined groups (categories) based on their content. It uses a mathematical function called a classifier to match texts to the correct categories.

* **Types of Classification:**
    * **Single-label:** Exactly one category is assigned to each document. When there are only two categories, it is called binary classification;
    * **Multi-label:** Any number of categories can be assigned to a single document;
* **Common Applications:** Spam detection (intent detection), social media monitoring (sentiment analysis), sorting emails and virtual assistants (speech recognition).

## 📖 2.2 **Approaches to Text Classification**

* **Rule-based:** Uses manual, handcrafted linguistic rules and lists of words to classify text. This method takes a lot of time to build and is hard to expand;
* **Machine Learning (ML):** Uses algorithms to learn patterns from large sets of annotated (labeled) data. This requires a step called feature extraction, which turns text into measurable data;
* **Deep Learning:** Uses complex computational models with multiple processing layers to learn data representations automatically. It easily integrates pre-trained word embeddings (numerical representations of words);

## 📖 2.3 **The Machine Learning Pipeline**

* **Steps:** The text goes through Feature Extraction, followed by Dimensionality Reduction, then Classification (using a learning model), and finally Prediction and Evaluation;
* **Popular Algorithms:** **Logistic Regression** (_LR_), **Support Vector Machines** (_SVM_), **K-Nearest Neighbors** (_KNN_), **Naïve Bayes** (_NB_), **Decision Trees** (_DT_), **Random Forest** (_RF_) and **Neural Networks** (_NN_).

## 📖 2.4 **Dimensionality Reduction**

**Definition:** A technique to simplify datasets by reducing the number of features while keeping the most important information.

* **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: Transforms data into new, uncorrelated variables that capture the maximum amount of original information;
* **t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)**: **unsupervised non-linear technique**, is a visual tool that groups similar high-dimensional data points together in a simple 2D or 3D visual space;
* **LSA (Latent Semantic Analysis):** The method applies **Singular Value Decomposition** (_SVD_). Reduces features while preserving the semantic (meaning) similarity between texts, changing sparse high-dimensional data into dense low-dimensional data. The output vector space is called **Latent Semantic Indexing** (_LSI_).

## 📖 2.5 **Text Pre-Processing**

**Definition:** Cleaning and standardizing text before it is analyzed.

* **Key Steps:**
    * **Tokenization:** Breaking text into smaller units, like individual words;
    * **Stop words removal:** Removing very common words (_e.g., "the", "is"_) that carry little useful information;
    * **Stemming & Lemmatization:** Reducing words to their base or dictionary root form (_e.g., "studying" becomes "study"_);
    * **POS-tagging:** Labeling the part of speech for each word, such as noun or verb;
    * **NER (Named Entity Recognition):** Identifying specific names, places or organizations..

## 📖 2.6 **Text Representation (Syntactic Features)**

**Definition:** Methods for converting text into numbers so a computer can process it.

* **One-Hot Encoding:** The simplest method where a vocabulary is built, and each word gets a unique vector filled with 0s except for a single 1. It cannot measure similarity between words;
* **Bag of Words (BOW):** Counts the unique words in a text but completely loses the order in which they appeared;
* **N-grams:** Groups sequences of words or characters together to keep some local order. _Example: A word-level bigram for "One Two" groups them together_;
* **Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF):** Measures how relevant a word is to a specific document within a larger collection.
    * *TF* counts how often the word appears in the document;
    * *IDF* checks how rare the word is across all documents;
    * *Drawback:* These methods create sparse data with very high dimensionality.

## 📖 2.7 **Semantic Representations and Language Models**

**Vector Space Models (VSM):** Represents words or documents as vectors in a space where items with similar meanings are located close together. These are called embeddings.

* **Word2Vec:** A simple neural network that learns word meanings based on context:
    * *CBOW:* Predicts a missing target word based on the surrounding context. Faster and better for frequent words;

    * *Skip-gram:* Predicts the surrounding context based on a single target word. Better for rare words;

* **FastText:** Improves on Word2Vec by generating numerical representations for parts of words (character n-grams), allowing it to guess embeddings for words it has never seen before;
* **GloVe:** Learns word representations by looking at global word co-occurrence statistics across a whole corpus;

* **Doc2Vec:** Extends Word2Vec to create a single vector representation for an entire paragraph or document;

* **Top2Vec:** Automatically finds dense areas of similar documents to detect topics without needing to know the number of topics in advance;
* **CoRoLa:** A massive reference corpus for the Romanian language used to generate specific semantic representations (embeddings) for Romanian words.

## 📖 2.8 **Transfer Learning & Contextualized Embeddings**
* **Transfer Learning:** Taking a large model trained on massive amounts of general data (pre-training) and tweaking it for a specific task using labeled data (fine-tuning);
* **Contextualized Embeddings:** Dynamic representations where the exact same word receives a different numerical vector depending on the surrounding context in a sentence.

## 📖 2.9 **Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT)**

**Definition:** A powerful language model that reads sequences of words in both directions at the same time to deeply understand context.

* **Training Tasks:**
    * **Masked Language Modeling (MLM):** Randomly hides 15% of the input words and trains the model to predict them using both the left and right context;
    * **Next Sentence Prediction (NSP):** Trains the model to predict the likelihood that one sentence logically follows another;
* **Model Variations:**
    * **RoBERT:** Improves BERT by removing the NSP task and using much more data;
    * **DistilBERT:** A smaller, compressed version of BERT that trains faster;
    * **Romanian BERTs:** Specific Transformer models exist for Romanian (e.g., Romanian DistilBERT) and are evaluated on tasks like Emotion Detection and Named Entity Recognition.
